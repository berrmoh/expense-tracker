# Overview

This project is an **Expense Tracker** program written in Java, designed to help users record, view, and analyze their daily expenses. The software allows users to input expense details, calculate total expenses, and save/load data for persistence across sessions. 

The purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, file handling, and the Java Collection Framework. Through this project, I explored how to effectively structure a Java application while incorporating various features of the language.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the following tools and technologies:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17**
- **Visual Studio Code** with the **Java Extension Pack**
- Java libraries for file input/output and collections, including `ArrayList` and `ObjectOutputStream`.

# Future Work

- Add inheritance by introducing an abstract class for expenses.
- Implement an interface for operations like adding, viewing, and calculating expenses.
- Enhance the user interface by incorporating a graphical front-end using JavaFX or Swing.
- Add advanced filtering options for expenses based on category or date.
- Implement multi-user functionality for better scalability.
